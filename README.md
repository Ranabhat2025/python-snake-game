## How to Play

1. Run the game:

```bash
python main.py
```

2. Control the snake using the arrow keys:

* **Up**: Move up
* **Down**: Move down
* **Left**: Move left
* **Right**: Move right

3. Eat the food (pink circle) to grow the snake and increase your score.
4. Avoid colliding with the walls or your own tail — collision resets the snake and score.
